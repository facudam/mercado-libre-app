# Mercado libre clone
This project is a sample application that utilizes the Mercado Libre API to display product information and perform searches. It simulates the purchase of products by adding them to a shopping cart.

I have added an extra functionality that helps users to obtain easy information between a group of products, making it easier to choose between them.
