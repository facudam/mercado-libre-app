# Mercado libre clone
This project is a sample application that utilizes the Mercado Libre API to display product information and perform searches. It simulates the purchase of products by adding them to a shopping cart.

I have added an extra functionality that helps users to obtain easy information between a group of products, making it easier to choose between them. The user can delete products, update the list and keep searching without eliminate the list. If a product that has already been added is selected again the application will notify you and will not add it again.  

In addition, this functionality has an algorithm that recommends a product taking into account the reputation, the number of stars, the number of sales and the price of the selected products.
